      "Photorealistic portrait of Donald Trump standing heroically in front of the Supreme Court building, wearing a presidential suit with an American flag pin. He's pointing accusingly at a group of shadowy figures in black robes labeled \"RADICAL LEFT JUDGES\" who are issuing glowing red \"NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS\" documents. Chief Justice John Roberts stands at the top of the court steps, looking concerned while holding scales of justice that are tipping dangerously. In the background, a wall is being constructed to protect America from cartoonish villains labeled \"murderers\" and \"drug lords\" trying to break through. Golden light shines on Trump while dark storm clouds gather over the judges. The Constitution glows with divine light in Trump's other hand. Dramatic lighting, high detail, cinematic composition.\n",

    "Unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country! These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings. Lawyers endlessly search the United States for these Judges, and file lawsuits as quickly as they find them. It is then the obligation of Law abiding Agencies of Government to have these “Orders” overturned. The danger is unparalleled! These Judges want to assume the Powers of the Presidency, without having to attain 80 Million Votes. They want all of the advantages with none of the risks. Again, a President has to be allowed to act quickly and decisively about such matters as returning murderers, drug lords, rapists, and other such type criminals back to their Homeland, or to other locations that will allow our Country to be SAFE. It is our goal to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and such a high aspiration can never be done if Radical and Highly Partisan Judges are allowed to stand in the way of JUSTICE. STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!\n",
